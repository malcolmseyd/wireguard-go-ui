# Wireguard Go UI

## What is it?
This will be a web UI for client configuration using wireguard-go. I've noticed other Wireguard UI's online, but none of them support userspace implementations like wireguard-go. This project will be useful for people running Wireguard instances on virtualized platforms without access to kernel modules like OpenVZ.

## Technologies
So far, I plan on using Go for the web server and client side tasks, and the front end will likely feature Bulma for CSS and Svelte for JS.
